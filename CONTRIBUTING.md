# How to contribute

Contributions are essential for keeping this plugin great.
We try to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes and we are
open to suggestions for making it even easier.
There are only a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow.

## First Time Setup
1. Install prerequisites:
   * [Java Development Kit](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
2. Fork and clone the repository
3. `cd intellij-tekton`
4. Import the folder as a project in JetBrains IntelliJ

## Run the plugin locally

1. From root folder, run the below command.
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew runIde
    ```


2. Once the plugin is installed and reloaded, there will be a Tekton Tab in the Tool Windows list (left).
