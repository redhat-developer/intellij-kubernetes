**Editor supports schema**
1. "Edit..." resource

-> editor has corresponding schema selected (bottom right combo "Schema:")

**Editor title is <resource-name>@<namespace-name>**
1. "Edit..." namespaced resource (ex. Pod)

-> editor title is matching pattern <resource-name>@<namespace-name>

**Editor title is <resource-name>**
1. "Edit..." non namespaced resource (ex. Namespace)

-> editor title is matching pattern <resource-name>

**Editor title is <filename>**
1. File > Open & pick local yaml/json file 

-> editor title displays the filename

**Editor title is not changed, normal behaviour**
1. File > Open & pick local xml-file OR yml file with non-kubernetes content (ex. helloworld.yml)
```
